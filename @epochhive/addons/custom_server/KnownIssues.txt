Known issues

1. Missions sometimes are not triggered by players.
2. Missions are sometimes not completed even when completion criteria are met.
3. Infinite ammo is not working for at least some weapons. Probable cause is the arma engine as server logs show multiple errors related to weapons not being found.
	This impacts both vehicle-mounted weapons and AI weapons.
4. Emplaced weapons are not spawning correctly.
